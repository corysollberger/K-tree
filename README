The program works as stated by HW3:

Where the following methods are working:

c_k = I used the command, c 5, throughout my testing, and everything seemed to work.
	I also have a hardcoded way to fill the roots children
	
s_k_d = works, and orders the children
e_k = works
r_k = works, but for some reason doesn't find any key past the last child of the root
xs = works
xa = works
xb = works

The following methods aren't working:
xh
d_k
xp

The project seems to work fine for the above methods, with their little bugs.

Just run the commands by building a k tree, then you can modify with the other commands.
