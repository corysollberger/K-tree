c_k = I used the command, c 5, throughout my testing, and everything seemed to work.
	I also have a hardcoded way to fill the roots children
	
s_k_d = works, and orders the children
e_k = works
r_k = works, but for some reason doesn't find any key past the last child of the root
xs = works
xa = works
xb = works

Just run the commands by building a k tree, then you can modify with the other commands.
